Hi Rajeev

(Will move Pradeep to bcc to save him from all the chatter :-) )

Good morning!!
Monday I am away from office having some meetings for Intech50 (intech50.com).
Here is my schedule for the week : Tue/Wed I am relatively free after noon
until 5 or so and Thu I am all day at Netmagic event and also MS Accl
event, and Fri again I am out of office :-(

Will Tue/Wed after 12 works? please let me know. If not we could figure out
a time to meet say early morning or late in the evening.

Look forward to your reply
Have a great sunday
Best Regards
Manju
