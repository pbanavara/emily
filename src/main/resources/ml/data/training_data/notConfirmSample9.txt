Thanks for the invite.

However, I have the following concern.

Nabanita, Samidh and I come to work at 8:30am. Staying back till 19:30
would be that we would be here for 11 hours every day. I do not mind
stretching once in a while, but it would not be feasible for me to stretch
to 11 hours every day.
Is it possible to reschedule the meetings earlier, at about 17:00, so that
I can leave by 17:30?
