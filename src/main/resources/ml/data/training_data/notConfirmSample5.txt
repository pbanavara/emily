Hello! Sorry for the late reply and missing your call. Life has been crazy
hectic (as always), work has been extremely tiring and is keeping me on my
toes.

Congratulations on the new job. I can spare gyaan - but how much it'll be
able to help, I don't know.

I'm off travelling last week of April to May 13, and I have tons of stuff
to finish before that. Can we meet after I come back?

How's baby doing? What have you named her?
